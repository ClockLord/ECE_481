# ECE_481
### Bradley University Class work for ECE_481 Digital Systems with Spartan 7 FPGA board

Projects are programmed in vhdl using the Vivado IDE.  
Projects are defined as assignments from the ECE_481 class.

### Class Description
"A structured guide to the modeling of the design of digital systems, using VHDL, a hardware description language. VHDL is designed to fill a number of needs in the design process. It allows description of the structure of a system and the specification of the function using familiar programming language forms. As a result it allows the design of a system to be simulated and synthesized. Cross-listed as ECE 581. CoRequisite: Concurrent enrollment in ECE322."
